"""
Abstract base class for the forward model Classes.

The ABCModelBase class provides the methods needed to implement the common API
for the various forward model classes. It operates as a mixin, but uses the
abc module from the stdlib, hence it is only available for Python >= 2.6.

class ABCForwardModel(abc.ABC):
    """An abstract base class for immutable forward model classes.

    ABCPolyBase provides the standard Python numerical methods
    '+', '-', '*', '//', '%', 'divmod', '**', and '()' along with the
    methods listed below.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coef : array_like
        Series coefficients in order of increasing degree, i.e.,
        ``(1, 2, 3)`` gives ``1*P_0(x) + 2*P_1(x) + 3*P_2(x)``, where
        ``P_i`` is the basis polynomials of degree ``i``.
    domain : (2,) array_like, optional
        Domain to use. The interval ``[domain[0], domain[1]]`` is mapped
        to the interval ``[window[0], window[1]]`` by shifting and scaling.
        The default value is the derived class domain.
    window : (2,) array_like, optional
        Window, see domain for its use. The default value is the
        derived class window.
    symbol : str, optional
        Symbol used to represent the independent variable in string
        representations of the polynomial expression, e.g. for printing.
        The symbol must be a valid Python identifier. Default value is 'x'.

        .. versionadded:: 1.24

    Attributes
    ----------
    coef : (N,) ndarray
        Series coefficients in order of increasing degree.
    domain : (2,) ndarray
        Domain that is mapped to window.
    window : (2,) ndarray
        Window that domain is mapped to.
    symbol : str
        Symbol representing the independent variable.

    Class Attributes
    ----------------
    maxpower : int
        Maximum power allowed, i.e., the largest number ``n`` such that
        ``p(x)**n`` is allowed. This is to limit runaway polynomial size.
    domain : (2,) ndarray
        Default domain of the class.
    window : (2,) ndarray
        Default window of the class.
